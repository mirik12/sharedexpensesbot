**Shared Expenses Bot**
Shared Expenses Bot is a Telegram bot designed to solve the problem of managing expenses within a group or family, particularly when the members are dispersed across different locations. The idea for this bot originated from the need to address the challenges that arise when individuals or families living in various parts of the world, often as a group, need to track shared expenses such as groceries, hygiene products, and other shared items.

**Problem**
The problem arises from the complexity of tracking and allocating expenses within a group or family when the members are geographically separated. This situation can lead to difficulties, misunderstandings, and potential financial issues when it comes to calculating and managing shared expenses.

**Solution**
The Shared Expenses Bot offers a convenient solution for recording and managing expenses within a group or family. With this bot, users can:

Record expenses, including the amount, date, and description.
Track the overall budget of the group or family.
Receive notifications about new expenses and updates to the budget.
This bot facilitates clear communication and efficient expense management among the group or family members, ensuring transparency and reducing the potential for conflicts or misunderstandings.
